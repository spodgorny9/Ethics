# Ethics

During my Sophomore year at DU I took a Business Ethics and Legal studies class as part of the Daniels Core classes. On the first day of class, the professor mentioned the idea that "you learned all you needed to know about being a good person when you were in kindergarten." While this was obviously a light hearted take as an introduction to ethics, I think there is some significance to this view.
