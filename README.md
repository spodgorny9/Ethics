# Ethics

During my Sophomore year at DU I took a Business Ethics and Legal studies class as part of the Daniels Core classes. On the first day of class, the professor proposed the idea that "you learned all you needed to know about being a good person when you were in kindergarten." While this was obviously a light hearted take as an introduction to ethics, I think there is some significance to this view and I appreciated the simplified outlook on an endlessly complex topic. In reflecting on this class I admire the emphasis that the college of business placed on ethics via this class and the weekend long Ethics Bootcamp all of the students participated in. I also appreciate the schools approach to ethics that is very much focused on self and determining how we can act in a manner to feel content and joyful in our lives. One of my biggest takeaways from this experience was just how much of an emphasis was placed on happiness throughout this course. I remember thinking that a business school that is willing to dedicate significant amounts of time to discussions about happiness and tell their students that it is not all about money is pretty unique and I feel grateful to be a part of this culture. Afterall, happiness is a bigger part of ethics than we may initially think.
